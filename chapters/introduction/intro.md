Introduction
=======================

[Python][python] is a powerful, open-source programming language for data wrangling, analysis and visualization. Python is becoming the preferred programming language for [scientific computing][scipycomp] and, increasingly, implementations of new machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms are being developed with Python.

This workshop introduces participants to Python programming, and simple analysis and data visualization techniques. The workshop is geared toward those with little or no prior experience with programming. Interactive quizzes and exercises will be included in the workshop, giving students the opportunity to test their knowledge and employ the discussed techniques.

## Format
The workshop is presented online via two asynchronous, interactive modules. Laptops and an internet connection are required. In the first module, the focus will be on introductory programming concepts, and Python-specific syntax and usage. The second module will focus on simple data analysis and visualization, specifically using the Python packages [numpy][numpy], [scipy][scipy] and [matplotlib][plt].
