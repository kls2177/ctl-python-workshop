# About this book

This short course is powered by [JupyterBook][jupyterbook], and provides:
- **interactive** and **step-by-step** examples (integration with JupyterHub and Binder allows readers to run and modify code examples)
- **free** and **open** access (permissive license, sources and content available through github)

This short course is a **work-in-progress** and the content will continue to grow, change and evolve over time. Feedback on how to improve the book is welcome!

The JupyterBook source and all course content (mostly [Jupyter Notebook][notebook] files) are all in [this github repository][repo].

The material is licensed for permissive re-use under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY 4.0)][cc] license.

Special thanks to a former UTSC undergraduate student, Jun Zheng, for helping to put together the first iteration of this workshop.
