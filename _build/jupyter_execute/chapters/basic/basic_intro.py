# ## Interacting Python
# 
# There are three main ways to use python:
# 
# - running a python file from the command line, e.g. python myscript.py
# - through an interactive console (python interpreter)
# - in an interactive notebook (e.g. Jupyter)
# 
# In this course, we will mostly be interacting with python via jupyter notebooks.
# 
# The following video demonstrates the three different modes of interaction.
