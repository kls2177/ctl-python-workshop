# # Module 2: Intermediate Python
# 
# In the last module we covered:
# 
# * using the Python interpreter, open by typing python
# * working in Jupyter Notebooks
# * arithmetic operations: + - * / ** // %.
# * conditionals: if(expression), elif, else
# * loops: while, for
# * lists, tuples and dictionaries
# * functions
# 
# In Module 2, we will explore using the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) packages.
# 
# NumPy is a Python package that provides more functionality than the vanilla Python. Matplotlib is a Python package for plotting and data visualization. These two packages are the foundation of scientific computing in Python.
# 
# So, why do we need NumPy? Let's take a look at an example in the video below.
