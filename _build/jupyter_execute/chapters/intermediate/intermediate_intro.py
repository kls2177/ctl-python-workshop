# Module 2: Intermediate Python

In the last module we covered:

* using the Python interpreter, open by typing python
* working in Jupyter Notebooks
* arithmetic operations: + - * / ** // %.
* conditionals: if(expression), elif, else
* loops: while, for
* lists, tuples and dictionaries
* functions

In Module 2, we will explore using the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) packages.

NumPy is a Python package that provides more functionality than the vanilla Python. Matplotlib is a Python package for plotting and data visualization. These two packages are the foundation of scientific computing in Python.

So, why do we need NumPy? Let's take a look at an example in the video below. 

from IPython.display import IFrame
 
IFrame("https://play.library.utoronto.ca/embed/07158a48e178876ba88a21a10a574fff", width="560",height="315")

Once you have watched the video, you can launch your own blank jupyter notebook and follow along.

### Let's get started!
