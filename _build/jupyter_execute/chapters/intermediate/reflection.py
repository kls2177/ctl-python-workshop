# Reflection

I hope that this workshop has provided you with a useful overview of programming in Python. If you are interested in learning more, there are many, *many* online Python courses available and many are free (just google "python course").

As the final part of this workshop, I ask that you reflect on how familiarizing yourself with Python may help you in your graduate research or future career.

### Happy coding!
