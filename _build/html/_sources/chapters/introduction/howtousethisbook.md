# How to use this book

This website uses [jupyter notebooks][jupyter] to display python code and it uses [binder][https://mybinder.org/] and [Thebe][thebe] to allow for users to interact with the code.

There are two approaches to coding in this course. The first and recommended is to install your own copy of python on your laptop of computer and a follow along with the course. You are able to copy and past the python code into your own jupyter notebook and then interact with it yourself.

I recommend installing python using the [Anaconda distribution][anaconda]. Follow the installation steps [here][install].

Alternatively, you can simply interact with the code using the "Live Code/Launch Thebe" button in the upper right corner of the website.
